# MAD257Git-Collaboration
Github collaboration assignment for MAD257 class

## Steps:

- FORK a copy of this repo
- create a new branch for your stuff (name it with your initals in there - like kamBranch or something)
- add a new file - use your initials in the name and on commit(s)
- make a small change to a line of text in one of the files - use your initials in the line and on commit(s)
- generate a pull request
- send a message on Canvas to let me know that you sent a PULL request

- I will then approve the request and merge :)

PS. If you see reference to user catnap8888, that's my test github id.  I forked a branch using that id and did 
parts of the assignment on my own.  Note:  Because of git config, I had to use an entirely different laptop
so that I wouldn't mess up my MAC (I could've made this work but it would have been a pain).  So, what am I saying? 
...Don't attempt to do the same thing I did using two github ids unless you're really good at github and using
the command line.
